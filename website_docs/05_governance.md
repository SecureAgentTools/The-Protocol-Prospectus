# Governance: The Path to True Decentralization

## The Stewardship Pledge

We believe that true decentralization is earned, not declared. The Protocol begins with thoughtful stewardship and transitions to community governance through proven milestones.

### Our Commitment
1. **Transparent Roadmap**: Every step toward decentralization is public
2. **Irrevocable Transitions**: Powers transferred cannot be reclaimed
3. **Community First**: Decisions favor long-term ecosystem health
4. **No Backdoors**: Technical decentralization matches governance

## Governance Evolution

### Phase 1: Foundation Stewardship (Current - Q4 2025)
**Decision Makers**: Protocol Foundation  
**Scope**: Technical standards, security patches, economic parameters

During this phase:
- Rapid iteration on core protocol
- Security-first decision making
- Partner onboarding and support
- Economic model refinement

### Phase 2: Council Formation (Q1 2026)
**Decision Makers**: Technical Council + Registry Operators  
**Scope**: Protocol upgrades, fee structures, federation rules

Transition criteria:
- 25+ active registry operators
- $10M+ monthly transaction volume
- 6 months stable operation
- Security audit completion

### Phase 3: Token Holder Participation (Q3 2026)
**Decision Makers**: Council + AVT Token Holders  
**Scope**: Economic policy, treasury management, grants

New capabilities:
- Proposal submission rights
- Voting on economic parameters
- Treasury allocation input
- Grant program participation

### Phase 4: Full Decentralization (2027)
**Decision Makers**: Decentralized Autonomous Organization  
**Scope**: Complete protocol governance

Final state:
- Smart contract governance
- Immutable core protocol
- Community-driven evolution
- No special privileges

- Rewards long-term thinking
- Reduces manipulation

### Futarchy
For parameter optimization:
- Market-based decision making
- Prediction markets for outcomes
- Data-driven governance

## Checks and Balances

### Multi-Signature Controls
Critical operations require multiple signatures:
- Protocol upgrades: 5 of 9 council members
- Treasury transfers: 3 of 5 committee members
- Emergency patches: 2 of 3 security team

### Time Locks
All non-emergency changes subject to delay:
- Economic changes: 7-day timelock
- Protocol upgrades: 14-day timelock
- Constitution amendments: 30-day timelock

### Veto Powers
Protecting minority interests:
- Registry operators: Veto on forced upgrades
- Large stakeholders: Veto on dilutive changes
- Technical board: Veto on unsafe changes

## Incentive Alignment

### Participation Rewards
- Voting rewards: 0.1 AVT per vote
- Proposal rewards: 100 AVT for accepted proposals
- Review rewards: 10 AVT for thoughtful feedback

### Skin in the Game
- Council members must stake 10k AVT
- Registry operators lock 40% of revenues
- Proposal submitters stake 100 AVT

### Long-Term Alignment
- Vesting schedules for all rewards
- Slashing for malicious behavior
- Reputation scores affect voting power

## Dispute Resolution

### Layer 1: Automated

3. **Transparency**: All governance actions are public
4. **Evolution**: Protocol can adapt to new challenges
5. **Exit**: Right to leave preserving value

### Amendment Process

## The Path Forward

Governance is not a destination but a journey. We start with benevolent dictatorship for efficiency, transition through representative democracy for stability, and arrive at mathematical democracy for permanence.

This is how we build institutions that outlive their creators.
